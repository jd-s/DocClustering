Recent studies have shown that these oligomers bind with high affinity to the membrane-anchored cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). It has also been proposed that this binding might mediate some of the toxic effects of the oligomers. Here, we show that the soluble (membrane anchor-free) recombinant human prion protein (rPrP) and its N-terminal fragment N1 block Aβ oligomers-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices, an important surrogate marker of cognitive deficit associated with AD. rPrP and N1 are also strikingly potent inhibitors of Aβ cytotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, experiments using hippocampal slices and neurons from wild-type and PrP(C) null mice (as well as rat neurons in which PrP(C) expression was greatly reduced by gene silencing) indicate that, in contrast to the impairment of synaptic plasticity by Aβ oligomers, the cytotoxic effects of these oligomers, and the inhibition of these effects by rPrP and N1, are independent of the presence of endogenous PrP(C). This suggests fundamentally different mechanisms by which soluble rPrP and its fragments inhibit these two toxic responses to Aβ. Overall, these findings provide strong support to recent suggestions that PrP-based compounds may offer new avenues for pharmacological intervention in AD.The pathogenic process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to be closely linked to the neurotoxic action of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers.

"node-1":{"Label":"1","abstract":"Simvastatin and atorvastatin facilitates amyloid β-protein degradation in extracellular spaces by increasing neprilysin secretion from astrocytes through activation of MAPK/Erk1/2 pathways.\n\nOne of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain. Aβ accumulation seems to arise from an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance. Neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) are the important Aβ-degrading enzymes in the brain, and deficits in their expression may promote Aβ deposition in patients with sporadic late-onset AD. Statins, which are used clinically for reducing cholesterol levels, can exert beneficial effects on AD. Therefore, we examined whether various statins are associated with Aβ degradation by inducing NEP and IDE expression, and then evaluating the relation between activation of intracellular signaling transduction, inhibition of cholesterol production, and morphological changes to astrocytes. Treating cultured rat astrocytes with simvastatin and atorvastatin significantly decreased the expression of NEP but not IDE in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The decrease in NEP expression was a result of activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not the reduction of cholesterol synthesis pathway. This NEP reduction was achieved by the release to the extracellular space of cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, the cultured medium prepared from simvastatin- and atorvastatin-treated astrocytes significantly induced the degradation of exogenous Aβ. These results suggest that simvastatin and atorvastatin induce the increase of Aβ degradation of NEP on the extracellular of astrocytes by inducing ERK-mediated pathway activity and that these reagents regulate the differential mechanisms between the secretion of NEP, the induction of cholesterol reduction, and the morphological changes in the cultured astrocytes.
