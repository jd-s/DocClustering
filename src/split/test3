"node-4":{"Label":"4","abstract":"Familial early-onset dementia with complex neuropathologic phenotype and genomic background.\n\nDespite significant progress in our understanding of hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, the list of genes associated with early-onset dementia is not yet complete. In the present study, we describe a familial neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically as the behavioral and/or dysexecutive variant of Alzheimer's disease with neuroradiologic features of Alzheimer's disease, however, lacking amyloid-β deposits in the brain. Instead, we observed a complex, 4 repeat predominant, tauopathy, together with a TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa proteinopathy. Whole-exome sequencing on 2 affected siblings and 1 unaffected aunt uncovered a large number of candidate genes, including LRRK2 and SYNE2. In addition, DDI1, KRBA1, and TOR1A genes possessed novel stop-gain mutations only in the patients. Pathway, gene ontology, and network interaction analysis indicated the involvement of pathways related to neurodegeneration but revealed novel aspects also. This condition does not fit into any well-characterized category of neurodegenerative disorders. Exome sequencing did not disclose a single disease-specific gene mutation suggesting that a set of genes working together in different pathways may contribute to the etiology of the complex phenotype.Despite significant progress in our understanding of hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, the list of genes associated with early-onset dementia is not yet complete.

"node-5":{"Label":"5","abstract":"Inhibiting BACE1 to reverse synaptic dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nOver the past two decades, many studies have identified significant contributions of toxic β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common age-dependent neurodegenerative disease. AD is also recognized as a disease of synaptic failure. Aβ, generated by sequential proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 and γ-secretase, is one of major culprits that cause this failure. In this review, we summarize current findings on how BACE1-cleaved APP products impact learning and memory through proteins localized on glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic synapses. Considering the broad effects of Aβ on all three types of synapses, BACE1 inhibition emerges as a practical approach for ameliorating Aβ-mediated synaptic dysfunctions. Since BACE1 inhibitory drugs are currently in clinical trials, this review also discusses potential complications arising from BACE1 inhibition. We emphasize that the benefits of BACE1 inhibitory drugs will outweigh the concerns.Over the past two decades, many studies have identified significant contributions of toxic β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common age-dependent neurodegenerative disease.
