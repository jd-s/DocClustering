Cholesterol regulates amyloid-β processing, deposition and clearance, promoting amyloidogenesis in the brain. ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) is a cholesterol efflux transporter that when absent increases and when overexpressed reduces brain amyloid-β deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. We examined whether alterations in ABCA1 expression and islet cholesterol content could also modulate islet amyloidogenesis. METHODS: Thioflavin S staining for amyloid was performed in islets isolated from mice with beta cell expression of human IAPP (hIAPP (Tg/o)) and cultured for 8 days following cholesterol loading, microRNA-33 overexpression (to reduce ABCA1 expression) or palmitate treatment in the presence or absence of ABCA1 overexpression or mevastatin treatment (to reduce cholesterol synthesis). hIAPP (Tg/o) mice were crossed with beta cell-specific Abca1-knockout mice (hIAPP (Tg/o) Abca1 (βKO)) and glucose tolerance and amyloid formation were assessed. RESULTS: Cholesterol loading and microRNA-33-induced reduction in islet ABCA1 expression increased Thioflavin S-positive amyloid in hIAPP (Tg/o) islets. Palmitate treatment also increased amyloid formation and this was reduced by both ABCA1 overexpression and mevastatin treatment. hIAPP (Tg/o) Abca1 (βKO) mice had increased islet cholesterol, accompanied by fasting hyperglycaemia, glucose intolerance, impaired in vivo insulin secretion and an increased islet proinsulin:insulin ratio. Amyloid area was increased in cultured hIAPP (Tg/o) Abca1 (βKO) islets compared with hIAPP (Tg/o) controls. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that elevations in islet cholesterol may lead to increases in IAPP aggregation and islet amyloid formation, further worsening beta cell function and glucose homeostasis.AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Islet amyloid, a pathological feature of type 2 diabetes, forms from the aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a beta cell peptide that is produced and co-secreted with insulin.

IDE (insulin-degrading enzyme) is one of the major proteases of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), a presumed causative molecule in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. IDE acts in the extracellular space despite having no signal sequence, but the underlying mechanism of IDE secretion extracellularly is still unknown. In this study, we found that IDE levels were reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD and in pathology-bearing AD-model mice. Since astrocytes are the main cell types for IDE secretion, astrocytes were treated with Aβ. Aβ increased the IDE levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, IDE secretion was associated with an autophagy-based unconventional secretory pathway, and depended on the activity of RAB8A and GORASP (Golgi reassembly stacking protein). Finally, mice with global haploinsufficiency of an essential autophagy gene, showed decreased IDE levels in the CSF in response to an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Aβ. These results indicate that IDE is secreted from astrocytes through an autophagy-based unconventional secretory pathway in AD conditions, and that the regulation of autophagy is a potential therapeutic target in addressing Aβ pathology.The secretion of proteins that lack a signal sequence to the extracellular milieu is regulated by their transition through the unconventional secretory pathway.
